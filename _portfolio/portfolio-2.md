### Context-Based Biased LLM (CB-LLM): Case of LLM for Palestine

In a world filled with competing narratives and conflicting information, it is crucial to develop technology that supports social justice and personalized education. Our team has built a Context-Based Biased Large Language Model (CB-LLM) designed to present factual and accurate information on specific areas of interest, particularly focusing on the case of Palestine.

### Data Overview

The CB-LLM has been trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising various sources related to Palestine, including:

- **Palestine Chronicles - Articles**: 8,788 articles (62,457 chunks)
- **Palestine Chronicles - News**: 14,418 articles (36,372 chunks)
- **Electronic Intifada - News**: 2,646 articles (20,805 chunks)
- **Electronic Intifada - Opinion**: 1,024 articles (11,237 chunks)
- **Electronic Intifada - Review**: 364 articles (3,018 chunks)
- **Electronic Intifada - Blog**: 6,529 articles (55,266 chunks)
- **Palestine Book Awards**: ~250 articles (171,274 chunks)

### Cut-off Date

The data used for training the CB-LLM is current as of September 30, 2023.
