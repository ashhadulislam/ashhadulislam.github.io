## Machine Learning Course Support

In this role, I provided comprehensive support for the Machine Learning course by conducting tutorials and overseeing exams through invigilation. 

### Tutorials

I led several tutorials aimed at reinforcing the key concepts taught in the course. These sessions provided students with hands-on experience, helping them to better understand complex topics such as supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and model evaluation techniques. My tutorials were designed to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, ensuring that students could confidently implement machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios.

### Invigilation

In addition to tutorials, I was responsible for invigilating exams, ensuring a fair and smooth assessment process. This involved preparing the exam environment, monitoring students during the test, and handling any issues that arose, such as technical difficulties or clarifying exam instructions. My role in invigilation helped maintain the integrity of the examination process, allowing students to perform to the best of their abilities under standardized conditions.

### Student Engagement

Throughout the course, I was committed to fostering a supportive learning environment. I actively engaged with students during and outside of tutorial sessions, offering additional help and guidance as needed. My approach was to be approachable and responsive, making sure that every student felt confident in their understanding of the material.

This experience not only strengthened my own understanding of machine learning but also enhanced my teaching and mentoring skills, equipping me to effectively convey complex concepts in an accessible manner.
