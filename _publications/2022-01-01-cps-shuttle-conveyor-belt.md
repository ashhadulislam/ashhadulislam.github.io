This paper introduces a cyber-physical system (CPS) demonstration designed for the mining industry, aimed at autonomously managing inventory control for multiple stockpiles using an automated shuttle-conveyor-belt operation. The CPS integrates sensing, optimization, and actuation within a smart manufacturing framework, leveraging Industry 4.0 principles.

The system uses a deep neural network for real-time sensing and evaluation of material levels in containers, while the optimization component employs a mixed-integer programming approach known as unit-operation-port-state superstructure (UOPSS). This approach allows for efficient decision-making and control of discrete operational variables, minimizing deviations from target inventory levels. The actuation is carried out
