This conference paper details the experimental framework and results of the IJCB 2022 Mobile Behavioral Biometrics Competition (MobileB2C), which aims to benchmark mobile user authentication systems using behavioral biometric traits collected during ordinary Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The competition utilizes the BehavePassDB database and follows a standard experimental protocol.

MobileB2C consists of four tasks, focusing on typical user activities: keystroke dynamics, text reading, gallery swiping, and tapping. The data comprises touchscreen interactions and various background sensor data collected simultaneously. The competition evaluates performance under both "random" (different users with different devices) and "skilled" (different user on the same device attempting to mimic the legitimate one) impostor scenarios.

The results demonstrate the feasibility of mobile user authentication through behavioral biometrics, despite the challenges presented. MobileB2C is set to become an ongoing competition, fostering continuous advancements in this field.
