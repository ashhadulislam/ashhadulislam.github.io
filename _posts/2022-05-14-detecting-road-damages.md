In this post, I take you through the process of building an object detection model using YOLOv5, specifically for detecting road damages from images and videos. This project demonstrates how to leverage transfer learning by training a deep neural network on your own dataset, allowing the model to detect specific objects of interest, such as abnormalities in X-Ray images or road damages in surveillance footage.

The tutorial covers the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and finally, deploying the model using a Streamlit web app. This web app allows users to upload an image or video of the road, and the application outputs the processed media with bounding boxes indicating detected damages.
