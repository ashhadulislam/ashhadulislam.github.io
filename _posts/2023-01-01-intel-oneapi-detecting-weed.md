In this post, I discuss my participation in the Intel® oneAPI Hackathon for Open Innovation, where the challenge was to detect weeds in cropland images using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The goal of this project was to develop a solution that allows for the targeted application of pesticides, minimizing environmental impact while maximizing crop yield.

Leveraging Intel's oneAPI DevCloud, I demonstrate how to use YOLOv5 for weed detection and share insights into the overall development process. This solution aims to reduce the indiscriminate use of pesticides, which poses health risks, by enabling precise weed management.
