In this post, I explore the capabilities of MemGPT in handling Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks, particularly focusing on its ability to assimilate information from multiple PDF files. While GPT-4 has its strengths, it often struggles with tasks requiring the consolidation of information from several documents. MemGPT, on the other hand, excels in this area, as demonstrated through a series of comparisons.

Imagine dealing with an organizational chart spread across multiple PDF files and needing to identify members of a particular department. MemGPT's capacity to integrate data from various sources and provide accurate reports makes it a powerful tool for such tasks.

To dive into the setup and see how MemGPT performs, Iâ€™ve used GPT-4 and OpenAI libraries as the backend for a fair comparison. While this post focuses on GPT-4, future articles will explore MemGPT's support for local models and open-source embeddings.
