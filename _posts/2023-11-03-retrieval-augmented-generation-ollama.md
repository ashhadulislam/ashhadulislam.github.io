In this post, I delve into the capabilities of Ollama, a powerful infrastructure that simplifies local execution of open-source models and interactions with PDFs. Ollama acts like a Docker system for Large Language Models (LLMs), allowing easy setup of local LLM servers, fine-tuning, and more.

I demonstrate how to use Ollama by setting up a system where I can chat with an LLM to extract specific information from a folder containing all my research articles. This process showcases how Ollama can be a game-changer for managing and retrieving detailed insights from extensive research data.
