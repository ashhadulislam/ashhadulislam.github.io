In this post, I delve into the development of deep neural network models designed to analyze satellite images for disaster detection. This project was part of the AWS Disaster Response Hackathon, aiming to create a system capable of identifying and categorizing disaster-stricken regions based on satellite imagery.

The tutorial covers the process of pre-processing large image datasets, training deep neural networks for disaster detection, and improving the model's efficiency by tailoring it to specific disaster types. Additionally, I demonstrate how to deploy the models using Streamlit, allowing for an interactive interface where users can analyze satellite images for signs of disaster damage.
