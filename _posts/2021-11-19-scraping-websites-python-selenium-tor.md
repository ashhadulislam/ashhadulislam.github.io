In this post, I tackle the common challenges faced when scraping websites, particularly the frustration of being blocked after making too many consecutive requests. I explore how to use Python, Selenium, and Tor to bypass these limitations, enabling you to continue scraping without interruptions.

Websites often block repeated requests from the same IP address to prevent Denial-of-Service attacks, which can significantly hinder your progress. By routing your requests through Tor, you can effectively disguise your IP address, making each request appear as though it's coming from a different location.

This article walks you through the setup and implementation of these tools, providing a robust solution to keep your scraping projects running smoothly.
