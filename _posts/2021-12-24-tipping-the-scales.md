In this article, I discuss the critical issue of imbalanced data in machine learning and introduce a novel augmentation technique designed to address this challenge. Even the most sophisticated models can fail if the underlying data is imbalanced, leading to misleadingly high accuracy rates while misclassifying minority cases.

For instance, consider a dataset with 9900 data points representing healthy patients and only 100 representing patients with an illness. A classifier trained on such data might incorrectly label all sick patients as healthy yet still report a 99% accuracy rate. This post delves into strategies to prevent such issues, ensuring your models are robust and reliable.
