In this article, I explore the application of deep learning techniques to detect Monkeypox from images, a timely topic given the World Health Organization's declaration of Monkeypox as a global health emergency. The project involves collecting and processing image data of various types of pox, including Chickenpox, Measles, and Monkeypox, to train models capable of distinguishing between these conditions.

Using the Pytorch deep learning library, I detail the steps of data collection, model training, and evaluation. The dataset used for this project is sourced from a repository maintained by Md Manjurul Ahsan on GitHub, which includes both color and grayscale images, as well as augmented data.
