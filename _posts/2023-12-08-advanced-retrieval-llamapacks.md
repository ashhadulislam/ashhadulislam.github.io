In this post, I explore five Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods open-sourced by LlamaIndex, which claim to simplify the RAG process to just about one line of code. Through a series of experiments, I test these methods and compare their effectiveness in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

The highlights? The Auto Merging Retriever Pack and Small-to-big Retrieval Pack from LlamaIndex emerged as the top performers. If you're curious about the details and how these methods stack up against each other, this post dives into the specifics.

For this experiment, I utilized OpenAI APIs for the language generation component, and the complete code is available as a Google Colab notebook.
